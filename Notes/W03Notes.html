    <h1>Objects in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>You can shorthand objects with methods which is pretty cool.</p>
    <code>user = {
        sayHi() {
          alert("Hello");
        }
      };</code>
    <p>Then you can call it: <code>user.sayHi();</code></p>

    <h1>"This"</h1>
    <p>Using "this" in code is a really good way to be able to use specific information in an object for methods.</p>
    <p>I've mostly used it in calling JavaScript functions that take an arguement, and that arguement is some input that the user will put in.</p>
    <p>Something cool about using <code>this</code> in JavaScript is that it is unbound.</br>
        It can be used in any function.</p>
    <p>Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” <code>this</code>. If we reference <code>this</code> from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.</p>

    <h1>Events</h1>
    <p>Events are things like clicks or changes to something.</p>
    <p>There are things called Event Listeners that monitor and wait for events to happen</p>
    <p>Event Listeners are used to trigger something when specific things happen that the developers want to keep an eye out for.</p>
    <p>Many common Event Listeners are placed on buttons, so that they do something specific when clicked. They can save information, or even do math!</p>
    <p>These are inline elments you can add like <code>onclick="clicked()"</code> and will call the function
        <code>clicked()</code> when the button gets clicked.</p>
