    <h1>Arrays vs. Objects</h1>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript are very different to Objects used in C++ and Java. They are more like JSON, in the way they are formatted with the variables.</p>

    <p>Arrays in JavaScript are more familiar, as you declare a variable, and then list the items inside the array that you want. I do feel as though arrays are closer to vectors in C++, as you don't have to declare a specific size and only stick to that
        size.
    </p>

    <p>What's interesting about Arrays is that they are just a kind of object, just specialized for storing sequences of things.</p>

    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>Functions in JavaScript allow for a whole host of things to become possible. As html doesn't deal in Functions it was necessary for the invention of JavaScript, or something of the like, so that web pages and web apps could become more dynamic and
        interactive than ever before. Can you imagine what the internet would be like without 90% of the functionality that buttons have because of JavaScript? Simple math even?</p>

    <h1>let, var, const</h1>
    <p>Sort of like the differencr between int, float, double, etc. let and var may seem very similar, but they allow for many different situations to be accounted for and efficiency in load times. Declaring a variable as a let allows for that variable to
        be used within it's block, but it is not needed anywhere else so space is saved with the webpage only worrying about the let variable where it was declared. Var on the other had allows for more versatility in use, and can be used in more places
        outside of it's block. Taking more time and space, but allowing for more functionality.</p>

    <p>While those variable allow for a change in value, it is also important to use const variables where needed. Const means constant, or an unchanging value. So if the value used will not be manipulated, it is smart to use the const variable to, again,
        focus on proficiency in the webpage.</p>
