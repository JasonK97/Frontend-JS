    <h1>Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation keeps all the programming <br />
        logic inside an object as well as all the methods, without the outside <br />
        world needing to know how itâ€™s done.</p>
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>In Object Oriented Programming, Polymorphism means that various objects <br />
        can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared <br />
        methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance allows for the taking the features of one object then adding <br />
        some new features. In Object Oriented Programming, this means we can take <br />
        an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. <br />
        We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <p>JavaScript didn't have classes before ES6, and used the concept of using <br />
        actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects. This is known <br />
        as aprototype-basedlanguage. Even though ES6 now supports classes, it <br />
        still uses this prototypal inheritance model in the background.</p>
    <h2>Constructors</h2>
    <p>In the objects chapter earlier in the book, we saw it was possible to create <br />
        new objects using the object literal notation. At the end of the chapter we <br />
        created a dice object: <br /><br />

        <code>const dice = {<br />
            sides: 6,<br />
            roll() {<br />
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br />
            }    <br />
        }</code><br /><br />
        An alternative way to create objects is to use aconstructor function.<br />
        
        This is a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. Here is the <br />
        dice example rewritten as a constructor function:<br /><br />
        
        <code>const Dice = function(sides=6){<br />
            this.sides = sides;<br />
            this.roll = function() {<br />
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br />
            }<br />
        }</code><br /><br />
        The keyword this is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor <br />
        function. In the previous example, we use it to set the sides property to the argument <br />
        that is provided to the constructor function, or 6, if no argument is provided. It also <br />
        adds a method called roll() , which returns a random number from 1 up to the number of sides the dice has.<br /><br />
        
        We can now create aninstanceof the dice constructor function using the new operator.</p>
