Arrays vs. Objects
    Objects in JavaScript are very different to Objects
    used in C++ and Java.  They are more like JSON, in
    the way they are formatted with the variables.

    Arrays in JavaScript are more familiar, as you declare
    a variable, and then list the items inside the array that
    you want. I do feel as though arrays are closer to vectors
    in C++, as you don't have to declare a specific size and
    only stick to that size.

    What's interesting about Arrays is that they are just a
    kind of object, just specialized for storing sequences
    of things.

Functions
    Functions in JavaScript allow for a whole host of things
    to become possible.  As html doesn't deal in Functions
    it was necessary for the invention of JavaScript, or 
    something of the like, so that web pages and web apps 
    could become more dynamic and interactive than ever
    before.  Can you imagine what the internet would be like
    without 90% of the functionality that buttons have because
    of JavaScript? Simple math even?

let, var, const
    Sort of like the differencr between int, float, double, 
    etc. let and var may seem very similar, but they allow
    for many different situations to be accounted for and 
    efficiency in load times.  Declaring a variable as a let
    allows for that variable to be used within it's block,
    but it is not needed anywhere else so space is saved with
    the webpage only worrying about the let variable where it
    was declared.  Var on the other had allows for more
    versatility in use, and can be used in more places outside
    of it's block. Taking more time and space, but allowing for
    more functionality. 

    While those variable allow for a change in value, it is also
    important to use const variables where needed. Const means
    constant, or an unchanging value.  So if the value used will
    not be manipulated, it is smart to use the const variable to,
    again, focus on proficiency in the webpage.
