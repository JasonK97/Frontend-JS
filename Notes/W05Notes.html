    <h1>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
        <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
        <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As programmers, we often have little influence over how external systems work, <br /> so it can be difficult to fix the root cause of system errors. Despite this, <br /> we should still be aware of them and attempt to reduce their impact by working
        <br /> around any problems they cause. Programmer errors are our responsibility, so <br /> we must ensure they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly. </p>
    <h1>Exceptions</h1>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
    <h1>Stack Traces</h1>
    <p>An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method <br /> calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single <br /> function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will
        work backwards from <br /> the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that <br /> started the sequence.</p>
    <h1>Warnings</h1>
    <p>Warnings are fine, we ignore them (just kidding)<br /> A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program <br /> to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good,
        <br /> but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to <br /> continue running incorrectly.</p>
    <h1>Strict Mode</h1>
    <p>ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits <br /> the use of some deprecated features. This is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding <br /> practices that were previously accepted as
        just being 'poor style' as actual errors. <br />
        <br /> Increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first, but it’s much better to <br /> spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later. Writing code in strict mode <br /> can also help improve its clarity and
        speed, since it follows conventions and will throw <br /> exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.<br />
        <br /> Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it’s forgiving of sloppy programming <br /> practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja <br /> programmer, so its use
        is recommended.</p>
    <h1>Debugging in the Browser</h1>
    <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. In <br /> many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated, so you’ll need to <br /> run through the program to see what’s
        happening at different stages of its execution. When doing this, <br /> it can be useful to create what are known as breakpoints, which halt the progress of the code and allow <br /> us to view the value of different variables at that point in
        the program. There are a number of options <br /> for debugging JavaScript code in the browser.</p>
